        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> I am an aspiring web developer. I fell in love with programming when I was 15. I actually developed a lot of games for fun and sold it to other students for their school projects. After graduating, I worked immediately as a C++ Game Programmer in a city far from my home province. 
        </p>
        <p>After 2 years, I had to come home and now have decided to pursue a career in Web development. It's an exciting tough road but I don't mind. I have grit. </p>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p> I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Firstly I’d like to work for a client or a web design firm and I will build credibility with them.
         I hope to be the best programmer & man in the family that I can possibly be. Everyday is a chance at improvement. There's no reason we shouldn't be taking that opportunity we have been given.</p>

         <p> So my plan is to get better. Personally & professionally. I will be better. Every day.</p>
